ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Patricia Rosalis! 

After three years of working as a hotel receptionist, I decided to quit tourism and make a life change!
I Did a web development Bootcamp at Ironhack Lisbo nand that's how I began my career path in tech.
At this moment I'm focusing on front-end development and design.
